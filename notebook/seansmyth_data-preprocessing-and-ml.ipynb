    "# Predicting Heart Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build, fit and compare a number of different binary classification models to try and predict whether a patient has heart disease using the 'Heart Disease Data Set' source from the UCI repository <cite data-cite = \"heart-disease\">(Created by Robert Detrano, Donated by David W Aha, 1989)</cite>. The specific dataset used for this project is known as the cleveland dataset, as it was taken from the V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The features include 5 numerical features and 8 nominal categorical features. The target feature is a binary feature, with 0 refering to a patient without heart disease and 1 refering to a patient with heart disease.\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "I have built the following classifiers to try and predict heart disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "* KNN\n",

    "* Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "* Decision Tree\n",
    "* Logistic Regression (both simplified and non-simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the cleaned data from phase 1, the process of transforming the data begins by encoding the categorical descriptive features by one-hot-encoding and then scaling the numerical features. The transformed data set was then split into a train and test set with a 70:30 ratio. From this split, the training set consisted of 212 rows, and the test set contained 91 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fitting one of the models mentioned above, the best features were selected using their respective F-scores inside a pipeline. In the pipeline, we consider 5, 10, 15, 20 and all the full set of 26 features (after encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the feature selection inside a hyperparameter search within a single pipeline, a 5 fold stratified cross validation took place to fine tune the hyperparameters. The AUC (Area Under Curve) was used as a the performance metric for each classifier. The stratified cross validation was used as it will help in making sure each fold is a representative of the whole, by using the same proportions of class structures <cite data-cite = 'CrossVal'></cite>, enabling less biased results. This cross validation strategy is essential as the target variable in this data set is unbalanced. Feature sensitivity was also examined as a result of the hyperparameter search.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Bernoulli Naive Bayes and the simplified Logistic Regression Models, new versions of the dataset were formed. With the Bernoulli Naive Bayes dataset looking at both a fully fitted binary model, whereby all the continuous features were binned and encoded, and a model that consists of just the binary variables. This was done to deal with the mixed dataset we have for this project. Like the Bernoulli Naive Bayes, the Logistic Regression model underwent two fits, one being a fully fitted model, and the other looking at a simplified model. To make a simplified model, the functions from the statsmodels.api, which contains the equivalent of the 'glm' function in R, were used in order to look into the p-value of each variable. From the p-value, predictors were cut until a satisfactory model was obtained. The simplified model was then tested against the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best model was identified for each classification model, a number of pairwise t-tests were performed, with a 10 fold cross validation performed against the test data. The performance metric was again the AUC score. Since there are a number of classifiers, the two Naive Bayes models and the two logistic regression models were tested first. The best models from each were then tested against the rest of the models, until the significantly best model was obtained. In addition to the pairwise t-tests, the confusion matrices and classification reports were printed for each model, allowing us to compare the recall score for each classifier."

Assuming all features are independant, we will begin to build this model by transforming the original data set into a set of binary variables. For this, we could either take the non-binary variables and bin them, for example, we could bin age into age group columns and give a binary 0 or 1 if a patient falls into that age group, or we could take away all the variables that are not binary. In this case we will do both by removing any non-binary variables and re-training the model and also binning all continous variables into binary columns. Since the target column is binary we do not have to binarize this column."

    "The modelling strategy implemented had a number of limitations. One of the limitations was the input - output approach taken in this report, as we were looking to find the best classifier based on raw predictive power. The main limitation based on this approach was the lack of in depth in the hyperparameter tuning. One example was the Bernoulli NB, where only the number of features was tested upon. In future machine learning tasks, further analysis on hyperparameter tunings should be taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next critique would be the feature selection method. Although the F-score feature selection technique is powerful, it does not take into account mutual information. (Chen Y. W, & Lin C. J., 2003)<cite data-cite ='Fscore'>(Yi-Wei Chen & Chih-Jen Lin, 2019)</cite>, combines this feature technique with both a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Random Forest Feature selector to get further information on these features. This allows for a more in depth feature selection method, taking many aspects into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature selection method also gives us next limitation; the number of features needed to predict heart disease. All of these models have 20 or more features, with the exception of the simple Logistic Regression Model. This may produce overfitting, and therefore incorrectly classifying future patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next limitation of this project is the number of observations. Since this dataset is based on the Cleveland data, it does not take into account the other data bases in the same UCI directory <cite data-cite = \"heart-disease\">(Created by Robert Detrano, Donated by David W Aha, 1989)</cite>, such as the Hungarian and Swiss datasets. These extra observations could give further insight into the predicting heart disease on a more generalised basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full Logistic Regression Model statistically outperforms all the other models at significance level of 10%. The hyperparameter space for this model was quite simple, further analysis considering other Logistic Regression parameters in the future would help in further tuning this model."

The Gaussian Naive Bayes Model and the K-Nearest Neighbour Model had the highest recall score ont the test data with of a score of 0.92.
