    "Employee attrition is a serious problem for a company, maintining its top talents can lead to a great reduction in costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the employee's productivity tends to diminish when they decide to leave the company and given that there's an overhead cost in replacing an employee and giving him the propper formation and time to adjust to the new position, it's safe to say that this is a costly event. Granted not all attritions are bad, some employees are just disrupting, but in general maintining the maximum number of employees as possible is a sound strategy, as described [here](https://inventiv.io/what-is-the-cost-of-replacing-an-employee/), [here](https://www.employeeconnect.com/blog/flight-risk-signals-what-makes-employees-leave/) and [here](http://analytics-magazine.org/predictive-analytics-the-privacy-pickle-hewlett-packards-prediction-of-employee-behavior/)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this context in mind we'll try to create a model to predict who's about to leave the company so we could report it to HR and they can decid to do something about it\n",
